CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN


Architecture
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project,
including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Express was used with node.js to handle the HTTP request.
JavaScript was used to enhance the HTML with interactivity and dynamic behavior. 
SPA was used to load the entire application and then updating the pages that were being used. 
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
MongoDB was used because it is flexible and has great scalability. It is the go to database for a project like this. 

Functionality
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
JSON only supports a limited number data types and does not understand functions or variables.
JSON is the format used to send data between the front and backend. This works great because of the standard structure of JSON. 

Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality 
and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
A lot of components were created to be duplicated. This saved time and improved efficiency because everything was the same, after the original was created and tested, it was known that there were no problems with it. This allowed for trust when reusing the same code. 


Testing
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, 
in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your 
understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
The different types of HTTP methods used when making request from the backend are  GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. 
Endpoints are specific URLS that connect to specific resources. 
Security is always important, so it was needed to learn how to add a security layer. 

To test the application, I used postman. This allowed me to test the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods. 

Reflection
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? 
This course will help me reach my professional goal by giving me some hands on experience or 
changing a static web page into a dynamic web page.

What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help 
you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
In this course I was able to learn some javaScript, spend more time working with MongoDB, remembering the html that I learned.
